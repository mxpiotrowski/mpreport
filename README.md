# mparticle and mpreport

The mparticle and mpreport LaTeX document classes are attempts at a more modern layout for articles and reports.  See my [dissertation](http://dynalabs.de/mxp/assets/diss.pdf) or my [master’s thesis](http://dynalabs.de/mxp/assets/ma-as-report.pdf) for examples of documents formatted with mpreport.
